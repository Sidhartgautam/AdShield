# üõ°Ô∏è Lynnchsid's AdShield

## Project Overview

**Lynnchsid's AdShield** is a lightweight and efficient Chrome extension designed to block unwanted advertisements and trackers, providing a cleaner and faster Browse experience. Built on Manifest V3, it leverages Chrome's `declarativeNetRequest` API for performant and privacy-focused content blocking.

## Features

* **Effective Ad Blocking:** Blocks common ad networks and tracking domains.
* **Redirect Prevention:** Helps prevent malicious ad pages from opening or redirecting your Browse.
* **Manifest V3 Compliant:** Utilizes Chrome's latest extension platform for enhanced security, privacy, and performance.
* **Declarative Rules:** Rules are processed natively by Chrome, leading to minimal performance overhead.
* **Simple & Focused:** Designed to be straightforward and effective without unnecessary complexities.

## Technologies Used

* **Google Chrome Extension Platform (Manifest V3)**
* **`declarativeNetRequest` API:** For efficient and declarative content blocking.
* **JavaScript:** For background service worker and any dynamic rule management (currently minimal).

How to Verify it's Working
Visit Ad-Heavy Websites:

Navigate to websites that are typically filled with advertisements (e.g., free news sites, video platforms).

Observe if banners, pop-ups, or video ads are no longer appearing, or if there are empty spaces where they used to be.

Use Chrome Developer Tools (Network Tab):

Open Developer Tools (Ctrl+Shift+I or Cmd+Option+I).

Go to the "Network" tab.

Reload the page.

Look for requests with a Status of (canceled) or that appear in red. These are often the blocked ad requests. You can also use the filter bar to search for domains like doubleclick.net, googlesyndication.com, etc.
